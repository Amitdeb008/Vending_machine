Vending Machine
***************
The code for vending machine is written in python. It is my first mini project for me in python.

Code for vending machine is very simple, basically it will ask user to insert below number of coins/notes
in dollars.

1. Number of 10p
2. Number of 25p
3. Number of 50p
4. Number of 100p  

If user wants to insert money in form of $0.10, $0.25, $0.50 and $1 then the amount of money will be accumulated and it will also display to user that how much money is inserted.

There are six options for the user to choose drinks. Drinks with it's respective price is being displayed in the vending machine display. Then it will ask for what user wants to buy.

This code will allow user to choose drinks for single and even for multiple times on user's wish. After choosing a drink machine will display drink name with its corresponding price to user and will also display the amount left by user to the machine.
 
Then it will ask user to choose another option for drink selection. If user presses 'n' then it will display summary of his transaction and will terminate the process.

If user's deposited money or balance is less than the cost of drink it will show shortage of money.
